# Simulation of Continuous Probabilities

## (Pseudo-) Random Number Generation  

- Assume we have a function $\text{rnd}$ that returns a random number in the interval $[0,1]$.
- In R, the `runif` function implements $\text{rnd}$.

```{r}
runif(5)
```

## Monte Carlo Procedures

Problem: Estimate $\text{Area of } E = \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx$ without calculus.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=4}
knitr::include_graphics("images/xsquared.png")
```

Solution: Generate pairs $x = \text{rnd}$ and $y = \text{rnd}$ and compute the proportion of times $y < x^2$. (See console.)

## Monte Carlo integrals in R

```{r}
set.seed(3242)
n <- 100000
x <- runif(n)
y <- runif(n)
sum(y < x^2)/n
```

*Note:* In general you need to multiply by the area of the rectangle, too.

## Group Exercise

## Buffon's Needle

Two things are random and independent:

- The distance between the center of the needle and the nearest line. 
    - $d = \frac{1}{2} \text{rnd}$
    - $0 \leq d \leq 1/2$
- The acute angle made by the line of the needle and the lines.
    - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{rnd}$
    - $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2$

The needle will intersect a line iff $\displaystyle{\frac{d}{\sin\theta} < \frac{1}{2}}$. (board)

## Buffon's Needle in R

```{r}
set.seed(8783)
n <- 100000
d <- runif(n, min = 0, max = 0.5)
theta <- runif(n, min = 0, max = pi/2)
sum(d < 0.5 * sin(theta))/n
```

## Buffon's Needle: Exact Solution

- We are drawing $(\theta, d)$ from the rectangle $[0, \pi/2] \times [0, 1/2]$.
- We are counting the points where $d < \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)$.
    - This is like doing a Monte Carlo estimate of an integral.
- So we are estimating the following:

$$
\frac{1}{\pi/4} \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{2}\sin \theta \, d\theta = \frac{2}{\pi}
$$
