# Selected Review Problems

Please see the study guide for a more comprehensive list of what the final exam will cover.

---

1. Make up an example of a (non-constant) probability density function for a continuous random variable $X$, obtain a formula for the cumulative distribution function $F(x)$, and compute $E(X)$ and $V(X)$.

---

2. Suppose that $X$ is a normal random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, and that $P(5 \leq X \leq 10) = 0.95$. Find values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ consistent with this information. Is the answer unique?

---

3. Explain, with diagrams, how the out-of-bag error (OOB) for a random forest is calculated.
