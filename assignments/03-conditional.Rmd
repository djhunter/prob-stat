Produce a PDF with solutions to the following problems, and submit the PDF on Canvas; due 1/22, 11:59pm. 

1. Do Exercises 26 and 28 pp. 153-154 of [GS].

2. Do Exercises 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 on pp. 172-174 of [GS]. Hints and advice:
    - On 1d, factor the polynomial.
    - For 5, compute the probabilities by taking ratios of areas.
    - For 6c, see the last part of Example 4.19.
    - Notice that Exercise 8 continues onto page 174. There are four events labeled (a), (b), (c), (d), so there are six pairs to consider.
